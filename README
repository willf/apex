NOTE: This is a Beta version of Apex 3.0.  It is lacking the level of
documentation, code cleanup, and general completeness we would ideally
prefer for our open source distribution, but is provided this way for
users who would like Apex immediately.

The most up-to-date Apex documentation can be found online at:

   http://apexdoc.pbwiki.com/

Please see the file LICENSE for terms of the NASA Open Source Agreement
under which this software is provided.

The contents of this directory are described as follows and represent
the 'apex' CVS module  (e.g. 'cvs checkout apex')

Apex distributions look a little different.  If this directory is
converted into a distribution it will contain additional files and be
missing some of those listed.  Directions for creating distributions are
found in 'notes'.
