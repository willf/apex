This directory contains Lisp patches for Apex.  A patch is a Lisp file,
provided in source and/or compiled form.  New patches should be added to
this directory.  Upon each new release of Apex, this directory will be
empty -- all previously existing patches will have been rolled into the
system.

The patch files have somewhat descriptive names.  For information about
the patches, see the FTP or Web site from where the patches were
obtained.
