Patches to the Emacs-Lisp interface are whole-file replacements for
files you have in your <Allegro directory>/eli/ directory.

The files currently available:

fi-basic-lep.el, fi-basic-lep.elc
   Hide the *LEP...* buffers from buffer list.

fi-emacs19.el, fi-emacs19.elc
   Fix fontification of defconstant in fi:common-lisp-mode.

fi-subproc.el, fi-subproc.elc
   Add `.' to the prompt regexp so prompts can reliably be detected.

fi-lep.el, fi-lep.elc
   Fix errors during symbol completion due to fontification in emacs buffers.
